# This Docker Compose is for the source environment.  It works with the client Dockerfile to
# set up a local development server that will automatically refresh for you.
# To use this source environment:
# $ docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build

client:
    build: . # Looks for the Dockerfile within the present working directory (pwd)
    ports:
        - "4200:4200"   # Default port for dev webserver
        - "49153:49153" # Live Reload Port
    volumes:
        - /usr/src/app/node_modules # Saves the node modules so it does not have to re-install
        - .:/usr/src/app # Mounts the host folder(s) onto the docker container for live development
    command: npm start # Kicks off the default `ng serve` command
